# Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting foreign currency exchange rates using historical data. The project uses linear regression models, including Elastic Net regularization, to forecast the exchange rate based on a set of input currencies.

## Overview

The main script (`main.py`) is structured to:
- Load historical exchange rate data.
- Allow user interaction for providing input exchange rates.
- Utilize linear regression models, including Elastic Net, for prediction.
- Output the predicted exchange rate.

## Features

- **Data Handling**: Reads historical exchange rate data from an Excel file.
- **User Interaction**: Interactive console input for entering exchange rate values.
- **Modeling**: Implements linear regression and Elastic Net regularization for prediction.
- **Prediction**: Outputs the predicted exchange rate based on the input.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages:

pip install numpy pandas


### Running the Project

Execute the script in a Python environment:

python main.py

Follow the prompts to enter the input exchange rates when asked.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the model accuracy or add new features like more complex algorithms are welcome. Please follow the standard procedures for contributing to a GitHub project.
